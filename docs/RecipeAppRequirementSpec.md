This section will contain a detailed break-down of user-stories, MVP (minimum-viable-product) features, and nice-to-have stretch goals.

## Feature Brainstorm
Listed below are ideas for possible festures for the SWErve team's recipe application.

### Wes's ideas
* A favorites section with stored recipes
  * Separate from saved recipes
  * Quick-add ingredients to grocery list from favorites
* A rating system for saved recipes
  * Sort saved recipes by:
    * Personal ranking
    * Aggregate community ranking
    * Type of cuisine
    * Meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert)
    * Calories or macronutrients
    * Main ingredient (Protein source: Beef, Poultry, Fish, Shellfish, Tofu, etc. )
* Filter out recipes that contain major allergens
* Quick-populate the next week or week in the future with current week choices
* Random choice add a recipe from site search to schedule for the week
* Email the schedule for the week (recipes and ingredients)
* Meal recommendation based on past choices
