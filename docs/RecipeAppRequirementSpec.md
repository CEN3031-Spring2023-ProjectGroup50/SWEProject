# Project requirements
This section will contain a detailed break-down of user-stories, MVP (minimum-viable-product) features, and nice-to-have stretch goals.

## Feature Brainstorm
Listed below are ideas for possible festures for the SWErve team's recipe application.

### Wes's ideas
* A favorites section with stored recipes
  * Separate from saved recipes
  * Quick-add ingredients to grocery list from favorites
* A rating system for saved recipes
  * Sort saved recipes by:
    * Personal ranking
    * Aggregate community ranking
    * Type of cuisine
    * Meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert)
    * Calories or macronutrients
    * Main ingredient (Protein source: Beef, Poultry, Fish, Shellfish, Tofu, etc. )
* Filter out recipes that contain major allergens
* Quick-populate the next week or week in the future with current week choices
* Random choice add a recipe from site search to schedule for the week
* Email the schedule for the week (recipes and ingredients)
* Meal recommendation based on past choices

### Seth's ideas
* search tools
  * Ability to input a list of ingredients and find recipes using those ingredients
  * Filter by amount of calories, meal type, other filters, etc.
* Login/account system
* Print out recipe to a file (PDF or text) 

### Emily's ideas
* "My Pantry" section to store ingredients the user has (from Seth's idea)
   * Input ingredients
   * Select ingredients to cook with and suggest recipes with given ingredients
   * Suggest ingredients to add to the pantry based on recipes with one or two missing ingredients
* Sort recipes by dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, paleo, etc)
* Calendar feature to be populated with meal plans
