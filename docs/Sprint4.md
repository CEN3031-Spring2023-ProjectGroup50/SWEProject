## Work completed in sprint 4

See the [Sprint 4 Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/CEN3031-Spring2023-ProjectGroup50/projects/9) for a kanban style view of work planned and accomplished.

### User stories planned for Sprint 4

At the end of Sprint 3, users could almost completely manage recipes in the application. They were able to view all recipes, click to view more details, 
search and filter using various criteria, add/edit recipes, and navigate easily throughout the UI. Next we needed to incorporate deletion of recipes 
and focus on the other primary purposes of our application: meal planning and grocery list generation. 

As a group, we reviewed the incomplete user stories from Sprint 3 as well as the backlog of user stories, and defined the goal for Sprint 4. 
Because our time was limited with this being the last sprint of the semester, our primary goal was to establish a minimal viable product (MVP) for an end-to-end application. 
With any remaining time, we hoped to enhance different elements of the app with nice-to-have features which may not be necessary for baseline functionality. 
We came up with the following plan.

MVP
1. [7] As a user, I can delete previously created recipes so that I can keep my list up to date. #45
2. [12] As a user, I can add a recipe from the list to my meal plan so I can set up my schedule for the week.#48
3. [13] As a user, I can view the current week's planned recipes in a list so I know what I will be cooking.#49
4. [14] As a user, I can navigate between each weekâ€™s meal plan views so I can look forward in time.#30
5. [15] As a user, I can click to generate a static list of groceries based on recipes in the schedule for specified days or weeks up to 1 month, so I know what I need from the grocery store.#31
6. [8] As a user, I would like to be able to save recipes so I can easily find and access them later. #46

Nice-to-have
1. [18] As a user, I receive errors that help guide me so I know what to do next#65
2. [19] As a user, I want to upload a picture to accompany my recipe. 
3. [10] As a user, I would like to search the recipe list based on meal type so I can more easily find what I am looking for. #27
4. [9] As a user, I would like to search the recipe list based on type of cuisine so I can more easily find what I am looking for.

    "Title": "Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella",
    "Ingredients": "['1 (3Â½â€“4-lb.) whole chicken', '2Â¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature', 'Â¼ tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'â…“ loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1\" pieces (about 2Â½ cups)', '2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1\" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', 'Â½ small red onion, thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', 'Â¼ cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', 'Â¼ cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white miso', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper']",
    "Instructions": "Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into Â½\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\nCombine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and Â½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\nAdd bread, apples, oil, and Â¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\nPlace onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\nPlace a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425Â°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155Â°F, 50â€“60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165Â°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMeanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\nUsing your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\nSet reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about Â¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6â€“8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\nServe chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Transfer with tongs to a shallow baking pan to cool. Return water to a boil and cook remaining 2 lobsters in same manner.\nWhen lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove meat from tail and claws and set aside. Cut tail shells and lobster bodies (not including claws) into 1-inch pieces with kitchen shears, then rinse well, discarding gills, eye sacs, tomalley, any roe, and claw shells.

Add 2 teaspoons gelatin mixture to each mold and freeze until set, about 10 minutes. Put 1 small sprig of tarragon and a tip of claw meat in bottom of each mold, then divide lobster meat among molds. Fill with remaining gelatin mixture and chill, covered with plastic wrap, until set, at least 2 hours.\nTo unmold, dip 1 mold in a pan of hot water 3 to 5 seconds to loosen. Run a thin knife around edge of mold and invert gelÃ©e out onto a plate. Repeat with remaining molds. Drizzle plates with fresh tarragon oil .",

    "Instructions": "Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add lentils and cook until just tender but not falling apart (they should hold their shape), about 20 minutes. Drain well.\nMeanwhile, whisk vinegar, honey, and 3 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl to combine; season with kosher salt and pepper. Set dressing aside.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add cheese and cook, turning occasionally, until heated through and brown and crispy on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (Some varieties of paneer are made without salt; if using one of these, season your pieces of cheese while cooking.) Transfer to a plate.\nAdd remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to same pan, then add sweet peppers and oregano. Season with kosher salt and black pepper and cook over medium-high, stirring and pressing down occasionally on sweet peppers with a wooden spoon so they make good contact with the pan, until softened and blistered in spots, 20â€“25 minutes. Remove from heat.\nAdd warm lentils and reserved dressing to pan and toss to combine, then toss in cheese.\nTransfer sweet pepper mixture to a platter or plates.

    "Ingredients": "['1 (3Â½â€“4-lb.) whole chicken', '2Â¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature', 'Â¼ tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'â…“ loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1\" pieces (about 2Â½ cups)', '2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1\" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', 'Â½ small red onion, thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', 'Â¼ cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', 'Â¼ cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white miso', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper']",
    "Instructions": "Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into Â½\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\nCombine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and Â½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\nAdd bread, apples, oil, and Â¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\nPlace onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\nPlace a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425Â°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155Â°F, 50â€“60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165Â°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMeanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\nUsing your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\nSet reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about Â¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6â€“8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\nServe chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Cook on high, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes, then cover the slow cooker and cook on low until the ham is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Hams vary in size and tenderness, so be patient. When itâ€™s tender, the meat should come off the bone with very little resistance. Taste a small piece for tenderness.\nTransfer the ham and vegetables to a deep serving platter (reserve the liquid in the pot).
