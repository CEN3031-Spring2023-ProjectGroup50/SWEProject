## Work completed in sprint 4

See the [Sprint 4 Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/CEN3031-Spring2023-ProjectGroup50/projects/9) for a kanban style view of work planned and accomplished.

### User stories planned for Sprint 4

At the end of Sprint 3, users could almost completely manage recipes in the application. They were able to view all recipes, click to view more details, 
search and filter using various criteria, add/edit recipes, and navigate easily throughout the UI. Next we needed to incorporate deletion of recipes 
and focus on the other primary purposes of our application: meal planning and grocery list generation. 

As a group, we reviewed the incomplete user stories from Sprint 3 as well as the backlog of user stories, and defined the goal for Sprint 4. 
Because our time was limited with this being the last sprint of the semester, our primary goal was to establish a minimal viable product (MVP) for an end-to-end application. 
With any remaining time, we hoped to enhance different elements of the app with nice-to-have features which may not be necessary for baseline functionality. 
We came up with the following plan. The bold comments show the status of each of these user stories.

MVP
1. [7] As a user, I can delete previously created recipes so that I can keep my list up to date. #45 _**(Done)**_
2. [12] As a user, I can add a recipe from the list to my meal plan so I can set up my schedule for the week.#48 _**(Done)**_
3. [13] As a user, I can view the current week's planned recipes in a list so I know what I will be cooking.#49 _**(Done)**_
4. [14] As a user, I can navigate between each weekâ€™s meal plan views so I can look forward in time.#30 _**(Done)**_
5. [15] As a user, I can click to generate a static list of groceries based on recipes in the schedule for specified days or weeks up to 1 month, so I know what I need from the grocery store.#31  _**(Done for up to 1 week)**_
6. [8] As a user, I would like to be able to save recipes so I can easily find and access them later. #46 _**(Done)**_

Nice-to-have
1. [18] As a user, I receive errors that help guide me so I know what to do next#65 _**(Done partially, and added snackbar messages to users)**_
2. [19] As a user, I want to upload a picture to accompany my recipe. _**(Done)**_
3. [10] As a user, I would like to search the recipe list based on meal type so I can more easily find what I am looking for. #27 _**(In Backlog)**_
4. [9] As a user, I would like to search the recipe list based on type of cuisine so I can more easily find what I am looking for. _**(In Backlog)**_

## Frontend Unit tests
Frontend Angular unit tests are located in files ending in `.spec.ts`. Each component and service has its own unit test file.

### Cypress end-to-end (E2E) tests
Frontend Cypress end-to-end tests are located in files ending in `.cy.ts`. Each feature of Mallow has a Cypress file, including
1. Login/Logout Feature
2. Recipes View (including add, edit, and delete)
3. Meal Plan View
4. Grocery List View

Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\nPlace a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425Â°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155Â°F, 50â€“60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165Â°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMeanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\nUsing your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\nSet reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about Â¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6â€“8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\nServe chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Transfer with tongs to a shallow baking pan to cool. Return water to a boil and cook remaining 2 lobsters in same manner.\nWhen lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove meat from tail and claws and set aside. Cut tail shells and lobster bodies (not including claws) into 1-inch pieces with kitchen shears, then rinse well, discarding gills, eye sacs, tomalley, any roe, and claw shells. Transfer to a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot, then add wine, carrots, celery, fennel, onion, garlic, large tarragon sprigs, salt, fennel seeds, red-pepper flakes, and remaining 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 6 cups, about 1 1/2 hours.\nWhile stock reduces, scrape any coagulated white albumin from lobster meat with a knife and cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces, then chill, covered.\nPour stock through a dampened cheesecloth-lined large sieve into a large bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Transfer 2 3/4 cups stock to a bowl. (Cool remaining stock completely, uncovered, then freeze in an airtight container for another use.) Sprinkle gelatin evenly over 1/4 cup stock in a 1-quart saucepan, then let stand 1 minute to soften. Heat over moderately low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is dissolved, then stir in vinegar and remaining 2 1/2 cups stock.\nPut molds in a baking pan. Add 2 teaspoons gelatin mixture to each mold and freeze until set, about 10 minutes. Put 1 small sprig of tarragon and a tip of claw meat in bottom of each mold, then divide lobster meat among molds. Fill with remaining gelatin mixture and chill, covered with plastic wrap, until set, at least 2 hours.\nTo unmold, dip 1 mold in a pan of hot water 3 to 5 seconds to loosen. Run a thin knife around edge of mold and invert gelÃ©e out onto a plate. Repeat with remaining molds. Drizzle plates with fresh tarragon oil .",
