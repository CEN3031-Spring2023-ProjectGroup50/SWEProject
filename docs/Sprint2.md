# Sprint 2
2/8/2023 - 2/22/2023

## Work completed in sprint 2

### User Stories

### User stories planned for Sprint 2
As a group, we reviewed the incomplete user stories from Sprint 1 and the backlog of user stories and defined the goal for Sprint 2:
(Tasks marked with an * were transferred from Sprint 1)

#### Closed:

1. [1] As a visitor I want to register so I can access the features of the application. *
2. [2] As an existing visitor I want to login with my username and password so I can view my account. *
3. [3] As a user I can view an existing list of recipes so that I can decide what meals to make. * 

#### Open:

4. [17] As an application owner, I want to use a JSON web token to authorize specific users to access the application upon login, so  I can control access to the app, prevent malicious attacks, and prompt login/registration when needed.
5. [4] As a user, I can click on a recipe card (or a recipe in the list) to view a side pane pop-up blade with details about the recipe including ingredients and directions.
6. [18] As a user I recieve errors that help guide me so I know what to do next. 

### Tasks

#### Closed:

1. [1] Route user to home page upon successful registration in UI
2. [17] FE: If token doesn't exist (i.e. user not authenticated), route them to login page
3. [17] Add a flag that doesn't allow a user to access the homepage(/home) without logging in first
4. [4] BE function to return all recipe details for a specific recipe based on rid
5. [3] BE function to pass some fixed number of recipes (10,20) to support pagination on FE dashboard
6. [3] Backend: write search functions to get a recipe from the database

#### In Progress:

1. [3] Populate cards on the dashboard iwth real data from the recipe table in DB (Task complete, needs testing)
2. [3] Dynamically populate all recipe cards on the screen with recipe data (Task complete, needs testing)
3. [3] Add pagination component to recipe dashboard (Task complete, needs testing)

#### To Do:

1. [17] Test authentication
2. [3] Investigate BE & FE image strategy (stretch goal)
3. [18] Investigate error handling in Fe so we have a better idea of what errors to surface in the backend (stretch goal)
4. [4] Create FE screen to surface detailed recipe info
5. [4] Populate detailed recipe info onto screen
6. [4] Routing to click from recipe card (entry point) to details screen, and exit details screen
