# Sprint 2
2/8/2023 - 2/22/2023

## Work completed in sprint 2

### User Stories

### User stories planned for Sprint 2
As a group, we reviewed the incomplete user stories from Sprint 1 and the backlog of user stories and defined the goal for Sprint 2:
(Tasks marked with an * were transferred from Sprint 1)

#### Closed:

1. [1] As a visitor I want to register so I can access the features of the application. *
2. [2] As an existing visitor I want to login with my username and password so I can view my account. *
3. [3] As a user I can view an existing list of recipes so that I can decide what meals to make. * 

#### Open:

4. [17] As an application owner, I want to use a JSON web token to authorize specific users to access the application upon login, so  I can control access to the app, prevent malicious attacks, and prompt login/registration when needed.
5. [4] As a user, I can click on a recipe card (or a recipe in the list) to view a side pane pop-up blade with details about the recipe including ingredients and directions.
6. [18] As a user I recieve errors that help guide me so I know what to do next. 

### Tasks

#### Closed:

1. [1] Route user to home page upon successful registration in UI
2. [17] FE: If token doesn't exist (i.e. user not authenticated), route them to login page
3. [17] Add a flag that doesn't allow a user to access the homepage(/home) without logging in first
4. [4] BE function to return all recipe details for a specific recipe based on rid
5. [3] BE function to pass some fixed number of recipes (10,20) to support pagination on FE dashboard
6. [3] Backend: write search functions to get a recipe from the database

#### In Progress:

1. [3] Populate cards on the dashboard iwth real data from the recipe table in DB (Task complete, needs testing)
2. [3] Dynamically populate all recipe cards on the screen with recipe data (Task complete, needs testing)
3. [3] Add pagination component to recipe dashboard (Task complete, needs testing)

#### To Do:

1. [17] Test authentication
2. [3] Investigate BE & FE image strategy (stretch goal)
3. [18] Investigate error handling in Fe so we have a better idea of what errors to surface in the backend (stretch goal)
4. [4] Create FE screen to surface detailed recipe info
5. [4] Populate detailed recipe info onto screen
6. [4] Routing to click from recipe card (entry point) to details screen, and exit details screen

Transfer to a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot, then add wine, carrots, celery, fennel, onion, garlic, large tarragon sprigs, salt, fennel seeds, red-pepper flakes, and remaining 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 6 cups, about 1 1/2 hours.\nWhile stock reduces, scrape any coagulated white albumin from lobster meat with a knife and cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces, then chill, covered.\nPour stock through a dampened cheesecloth-lined large sieve into a large bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Transfer 2 3/4 cups stock to a bowl. (Cool remaining stock completely, uncovered, then freeze in an airtight container for another use.) Sprinkle gelatin evenly over 1/4 cup stock in a 1-quart saucepan, then let stand 1 minute to soften. Heat over moderately low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is dissolved, then stir in vinegar and remaining 2 1/2 cups stock.\nPut molds in a baking pan. Add 2 teaspoons gelatin mixture to each mold and freeze until set, about 10 minutes. Put 1 small sprig of tarragon and a tip of claw meat in bottom of each mold, then divide lobster meat among molds. Fill with remaining gelatin mixture and chill, covered with plastic wrap, until set, at least 2 hours.\nTo unmold, dip 1 mold in a pan of hot water 3 to 5 seconds to loosen.

        "Ingredients": "['1 (14.5-ounce) can basic lentil soup, like Amyâs', '1 large onion, thinly sliced', 'Â½ tsp. turmeric', '1 tsp. cumin', 'Â¼ tsp. Aleppo pepper or â tsp. crushed red pepper flakes', '2 Tbsp. tomato paste', '3 large eggs', '2 Tbsp. ghee, unsalted butter, or olive oil', 'Â½ tsp. whole cumin seeds', 'Olive oil', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'Parsley, for finishing']",
        "Instructions": "Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 350Â°F.\nIn a medium, oven-safe pan, heat 1 Tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 large, thinly sliced onion and Â½ tsp. Kosher salt. Cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 25 minutes.\nAdd Â½ tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. cumin, Â¼ tsp. Aleppo pepper (or â tsp. crushed red pepper flakes), and 2 Tbsp. tomato paste. Cook and stir constantly until the onions are coated and the tomato paste has darkened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add â cup water; stir and scrape up all the browned bits on the bottom of the pan for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the liquid looks thickened and saucy. Add one 14-oz. can of lentil soup; cook, stirring to combine, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and season with salt, pepper, and more Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes to taste.\nUsing a spoon, create 3 wells in the lentil mixture. Carefully crack 1 egg into each well. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the whites of the eggs are just set, 11 to 13 minutes.\nWhile the eggs bake, in a small pot or butter warmer, heat 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, ghee, or olive oil over medium heat. Add Â½ tsp. cumin seeds; swirl the pan until the seeds start to sizzle and brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the heat.\nDrizzle the finished eggs with the butter mixture, season with salt and pepper, and garnish with parsley before serving.",
